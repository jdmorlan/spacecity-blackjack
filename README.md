# Spacecity Blackjack

First off, check out the site for the [Spacecity.js](http://www.spacecityjs.com/)
conference.

So, I have been playing around with React and Redux and I figured a Blackjack
game would give me enough complexity to sink my teeth into. I was trying to
figure out what kind of card design I wanted and thought...wouldn't it be cool
if we had playing cards based on SpaceCity and javascript frameworks.

The app uses the following libraries:

- React
- React Router

- Redux
- Redux Thunk (Asynchronous Actions)
- React Router Redux

Webpack and Babel are used to transpile the code from ES6/7 to ES5 code.
